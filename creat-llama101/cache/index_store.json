The height is the dimension perpendicular to the length. 2.3Minimum Flexibility Criteria for Flat-Size Pieces Flat-size pieces must be flexible. Boxes—with or without hinges, gaps, or breaks that allow the piece to bend—are not flats. Tight envelopes or wrappers that are filled with one or more boxes are not flats. At the customer’s option, a customer may perform the following test on his or her mailpieces. When a postal employee observes a customer demonstrating that a flat-size piece is flexible according to these standards, the employee does not need to perform the test. Test flats as defined in 201.4.3. Domestic Mail Manual • Updated 7-9-23 101 101.3.3 Retail Mail: Physical Standards for Letters, Cards, Flats, and Parcels 2.4Uniform Thickness Flat-size mailpieces must be uniformly thick so that any bumps, protrusions, or other irregularities do not cause more than 1/4-inch variance in thickness. When determining variance in thickness, exclude the outside edges of a mailpiece (1 inch from each edge) when the contents do not extend into those edges. Also, exclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this determination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of more than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be nonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the mailpiece (see 601.3.3). 2.5Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces Flat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are considered parcels, and customers mailing these pieces must pay the applicable parcel prices. 3.0Physical Standards for Parcels 3.1Processing Categories USPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories: machinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel.

The reply half may be formatted for response purposes (e.g., contain blocks for completion by the addressee). b. A double card must be folded before mailing and prepared so that the address on the reply half is on the inside when the double card is originally mailed.

Fasteners must be affixed according to the applicable preparation requirements for the price claimed. Any sealing on the left and right sides of the cards, no matter the sealing process used, is not permitted. d.

andriy@nomic.ai Abstract Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved human-level performance on a range of professional and academic benchmarks. The accessibility of these models has lagged behind their performance. State-of-the-art LLMs re- quire costly infrastructure; are only accessible via rate-limited, geo-locked, and censored web interfaces; and lack publicly available code and technical reports. In this paper, we tell the story of GPT4All, a popular  open  source  repository  that  aims  to democratize access to LLMs. We outline the technical details of the original GPT4All model family, as well as the evolution of the GPT4All project from a single model into a fully fledged open  source  ecosystem. It  is  our  hope  that this paper acts as both a technical overview of the original GPT4All models as well as a case study on the subsequent growth of the GPT4All open source ecosystem. 1  Introduction On March 14 2023, OpenAI released GPT-4, a large language model capable of achieving human level per- formance on a variety of professional and academic benchmarks. Despite  the  popularity  of  the  release, the GPT-4 technical report (OpenAI, 2023) contained virtually  no  details  regarding  the  architecture,  hard- ware, training compute, dataset construction, or training method used to create the model.

users could only access the model through the internet interface at chat.openai.com, which was severely rate limited and unavailable in several locales (e.g. Italy) (BBC News, 2023). Additionally, GPT-4 refused to answer a wide ∗ Shared Senior Authorship variety of queries, responding only with the now infa- mous \"As an AI Language Model, I cannot...\" prefix (Vincent, 2023). These transparency and accessibility concerns spurred several developers to begin creating open source large language model (LLM) alternatives. Several grassroots efforts focused on fine tuning Meta’s open code LLaMA model (Touvron et al., 2023; McMil- lan, 2023), whose weights were leaked on BitTorrent less than a week prior to the release of GPT-4 (Verge, 2023). GPT4All started as one of these variants. In this paper, we tell the story of GPT4All. We com- ment on the technical details of the original GPT4All model (Anand et al., 2023), as well as the evolution of GPT4All from a single model to an ecosystem of several models. We remark on the impact that the project has had on the open source community, and discuss future directions. It is our hope that this paper acts as both a technical overview of the original GPT4All models as well as a case study on the subsequent growth of the GPT4All open source ecosystem. 2  The Original GPT4All Model 2.1  Data Collection and Curation To  train  the  original  GPT4All  model,  we  collected roughly one million prompt-response pairs using the GPT-3.5-Turbo OpenAI API between March 20, 2023 and March 26th, 2023. In particular, we gathered GPT- 3.5-Turbo responses to prompts of three publicly avail- able datasets: the unified chip2 subset of LAION OIG, a random sub-sample of Stackoverflow Questions, and a sub-sample of Bigscience/P3 (Sanh et al., 2021).

lowing the approach in Stanford Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), an open source LLaMA variant that came just be- fore GPT4All, we focused substantial effort on dataset curation. The  collected  dataset  was  loaded  into  Atlas  (AI, 2023)—a visual interface for exploring and tagging mas- sive unstructured datasets —for data curation. Using At- arXiv:2311.04931v1  [cs.CL]  6 Nov 2023 las, we identified and removed subsets of the data where GPT-3.5-Turbo refused to respond, had malformed out- put, or produced a very short response. This resulted in the removal of the entire Bigscience/P3 subset of our data, as many P3 prompts induced responses that were simply one word. After curation, we were left with a set of 437,605 prompt-response pairs, which we visualize in Figure 1a. 2.2  Model Training The original GPT4All model was a fine tuned variant of LLaMA 7B. In order to train it more efficiently, we froze the base weights of LLaMA, and only trained a small set of LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) weights during the fine tuning process. Detailed model hyper-parameters and training code can be found in our associated code repository 1 . 2.3  Model Access We publicly released all data, training code, and model weights for the community to build upon. Further, we provided a 4-bit quantized version of the model, which enabled users to run it on their own commodity hard- ware without transferring data to a 3rd party service. Our research and development costs were dominated by∼$800 in GPU spend (rented from Lambda Labs and Paperspace) and∼$500 in OpenAI API spend.

performed a preliminary evaluation of our model using the human evaluation data from the Self Instruct paper (Wang et al., 2023). We reported the ground truth perplexity of our model against what was, to our knowl- edge, the best openly available alpaca-lora model at the time, provided by userchainyoon HuggingFace. Both models had very large perplexities on a small number of tasks, so we reported perplexities clipped to a maximum of 100. We found that GPT4All produces stochastically lower ground truth perplexities than alpaca-lora (Anand et al., 2023). 3  From a Model to an Ecosystem 3.1  GPT4All-J: Repository Growth and the implications of the LLaMA License The GPT4All repository grew rapidly after its release, gaining over 20000 GitHub stars in just one week, as shown in Figure 2. This growth was supported by an in-person hackathon hosted in New York City three days after the model release, which attracted several hundred participants. As the Nomic discord, the home of online discussion about GPT4All,  ballooned to over 10000 people, one thing became very clear - there was massive demand for a model that could be used commercially. 1 https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all The LLaMA model that GPT4All was based on was licensed for research only, which severely limited the set of domains that GPT4All could be applied in. As a response to this, the Nomic team repeated the model training procedure of the original GPT4All model, but based on the already open source and commercially li- censed GPT-J model (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021). GPT4All-J also had an augmented training set, which contained multi-turn QA examples and creative writing such as poetry, rap, and short stories. The creative writ- ing prompts were generated by filling in schemas such as \"Write a [CREATIVE STORY TYPE] about [NOUN] in the style of [PERSON].\" We again employed Atlas to curate the

again employed Atlas to curate the prompt-response pairs in this data set. Our  evaluation  methodology  also  evolved  as  the project  grew.In  particular,  we  began  evaluating GPT4All  models  using  a  suite  of  seven  reasoning tasks that were used for evaluation of the Databricks Dolly (Conover et al., 2023b) model,  which was re- leased on April 12, 2023. Unfortunately, GPT4All-J did not outperform other prominent open source models on this evaluation. As a result, we endeavoured to create a model that did. 3.2  GPT4All-Snoozy: the Emergence of the GPT4All Ecosystem GPT4All-Snoozy was developed using roughly the same procedure as the previous GPT4All models, but with a few key modifications. First, GPT4All-Snoozy used the LLaMA-13B base model due to its superior base metrics when compared to GPT-J. Next, GPT4All-Snoozy incor- porated the Dolly’s training data into its train mix. After data curation and deduplication with Atlas, this yielded a training set of 739,259 total prompt-response pairs. We dubbed the model that resulted from training on this improved dataset GPT4All-Snoozy. As shown in Figure 1, GPT4All-Snoozy had the best average score on our evaluation benchmark of any model in the ecosystem at the time of its release. Concurrently with the development of GPT4All, sev- eral organizations such as LMSys, Stability AI, BAIR, and Databricks built and deployed open source language models. We heard increasingly from the community that they wanted quantized versions of these models for local use. As we realized that organizations with ever more resources were developing source language models, we decided to pivot our effort away from training increas- ingly capable models and towards providing easy access to the plethora of models being produced by the open source community.

accessi- bility of open source language models. The repository (a)(b)(c)(d) Figure 1:  TSNE visualizations showing the progression of the GPT4All train set. Panel (a) shows the original uncurated data. The red arrow denotes a region of highly homogeneous prompt-response pairs. The coloring denotes which open dataset contributed the prompt. Panel (b) shows the original GPT4All data after curation. This panel, as well as panels (c) and (d) are 10 colored by topic, which Atlas automatically extracts. Notice that the large homogeneous prompt-response blobs no longer appearl. Panel (c) shows the GPT4All-J dataset. The \"starburst\" clusters introduced on the right side of the panel correspond to the newly added creative data. Panel (d) shows the final GPT4All-snoozy dataset. All datasets have been released to the public, and can be interactively explored online. In the web version of this article, you can click on a panel to be taken to its interactive visualization. ModelBoolQPIQAHellaSwagWinoG.ARC-eARC-cOBQAAvg.

1, 2023. Code models are not included. OpenAI’s text-davinci-003 is included as a point of comparison. The best overall performing model in the GPT4All ecosystem, Nous-Hermes2, achieves over 92% of the average performance of text-davinci-003. Models marked with an asterisk were available in the ecosystem as of the release of GPT4All-Snoozy. Note that at release, GPT4All-Snoozy had the best average performance of any model in the ecosystem. Bolded numbers indicate the best performing model as of August 1, 2023. Figure 2: Comparison of the github start growth of GPT4All, Meta’s LLaMA, and Stanford’s Alpaca. We conjecture that GPT4All achieved and maintains faster ecosystem growth due to the focus on access, which allows more users to meaningfully participate. provides compressed versions of open source models for use on commodity hardware, stable and simple high level model APIs, and a GUI for no code model ex- perimentation. The  project  continues  to  increase  in popularity, and as of August 1 2023, has garnered over 50000 GitHub stars and over 5000 forks. GPT4All  currently  provides  native  support  and benchmark data for over 35 models (see Figure 1), and includes several models co-developed with industry part- ners such as Replit and Hugging Face. GPT4All also provides high level model APIs in languages includ- ing Python, Typescript, Go, C#, and Java, among oth- ers.

(Note that all GPT4All user data is collected on anopt inbasis.) GPT4All has be- come the top language model integration in the popular open source AI orchestration library LangChain (Chase, 2022), and powers many popular open source projects such as PrivateGPT (imartinez, 2023), Quiver (StanGi- rard, 2023), and MindsDB (MindsDB, 2023), among others. GPT4All  is  the  3rd  fastest  growing  GitHub repository of all time (Leo, 2023), and is the 185th most popular repository on the platform, by star count. 4  The Future of GPT4All In the future, we will continue to grow GPT4All, sup- porting it as the de facto solution for LLM accessibil- ity. Concretely, this means continuing to compress and distribute important open-source language models de- veloped by the community, as well as compressing and distributing increasingly multimodal AI models. Fur- thermore, we will expand the set of hardware devices that GPT4All models run on, so that GPT4All models “just work\" on any machine, whether it comes equipped with Apple Metal silicon, NVIDIA, AMD, or other edge- accelerated hardware. Overall,  we envision a world where anyone, anywhere, with any machine, can access and contribute to the cutting edge of AI. Limitations By  enabling  access  to  large  language  models,  the GPT4All project also inherits many of the ethical con- cerns  associated  with  generative  models. Principal among  these  is  the  concern  that  unfiltered  language models like GPT4All enable malicious users to generate content that could be harmful and dangerous (e.g., in- structions on building bioweapons). While we recognize this risk, we also acknowledge the risk of concentrating this technology in the hands of a limited number of in- creasingly secretive research groups.

risk of focusing on the benefits of language model technology significantly outweighs the risk of misuse, and hence we prefer to make the technology as widely available as possible. Finally, we realize the challenge in assigning credit for large-scale open source initiatives. We make a first attempt at fair credit assignment by explicitly includ- ing the GPT4All open source developers as authors on this work, but recognize that this is insufficient fully characterize everyone involved in the GPT4All effort. Furthermore, we acknowledge the difficulty in citing open source works that do not necessarily have standard- ized citations, and do our best in this paper to provide URLs to projects whenever possible. We encourage further research in the area of open source credit as- signment, and hope to be able to support some of this research ourselves in the future. References Nomic AI. 2023.
